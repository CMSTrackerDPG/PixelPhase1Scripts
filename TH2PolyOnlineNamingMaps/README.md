TH2PolyOnlineNamingMaps
=======================

## What does it do?

The tool dumps dumps 3 png maps showing exact mapping of
  1. Plus/Minus Blade/Ladder,
  2. Inner/Outer Blade/Ladder,
  3. Barrel Sector.
  
Numbers are indicated not only by the color but also by the concrete text label. Negative numbers refer to Minus and Outer parts of the detector.

## How to run?

```python TH2PolyOnlineNamingMaps.py```

By default output maps will be saved inside ```OUT/``` directory (relatively to the current folder).
